/**
 * Barrel for the workspace tool layer, split into focused modules under
 * ./workspace/:
 *
 *   toolSchemas.ts        tool definitions advertised to the model + gating sets
 *   pathGuards.ts         workspace confinement + shared arg/output guards
 *   fileToolExecutor.ts   synchronous filesystem tool execution
 *   networkTools.ts       run_command / fetch_url / search_web + async entry point
 *   permissionPreview.ts  grant scoping, escape heuristics, permission-card preview
 *
 * Import from here — the public surface is unchanged from when this was one file.
